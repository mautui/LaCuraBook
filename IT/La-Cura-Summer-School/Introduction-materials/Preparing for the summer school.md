This document includes information for both teachers, tutors and students, to highlight what we think is needed to get ready for the summer school.

We aim to create an environment which is as collaborative and participative as possible. That includes the fact that everyone is invited to contribute to this document, to be able to bring up a constructive discussion about what we would really like to to during the summer school, and in preparation for the exhibit at La Triennale.

This document includes:

Introduction
This will be a peculiar summer school. It originates from a project called La Cura, which created a global performance engaging millions of people to transform what it means to cure and to confront with the complex problems of our society, creating wide processes in which sciences, arts, technologies, design, architecture and society collaborate and interconnect.

When, on March 2016, the book narrating La Cura came out in Italy, many things started happening. People started wondering whether this approach could be used to do different things, and they found out that they could. Connecting disciplines, methods, approaches, people and technologies, to bring up collaborative, sincere, efforts in which confronting with (and solving) problems was a matter of engaging the whole of society really seemed a good idea to confront with the complex issues of our planet: education, energy, agriculture, economy, and more. Workshop, lectures, participatory actions, PhDs, research projects started forming around a growing community. And the process continues.

This summer school is a really interesting outcome of this process.

The idea came up when La Cura brought together ISIA Design Florence, Nefula, the “Condividi la Conoscenza” event and La Triennale di Milano to explore the implications of “Condividi La Conoscenza” ’s theme for this year: “to inhabit the city, to inhabit the planet”.

“To Inhabit” is perceived, sometimes, as a passive verb: as something which is, rather as something which you do. It is, instead, a very active one, comprising of all the actions which you perform in your daily life to live in a place. “I inhabit.” Active. It is also an interconnective term, as the act of inhabiting cannot be truly separated from the actions of the other people who inhabit your same environment. Whether it’s a city, region, nation or the entire planet, all of these actions are interweaved, and the notion of where “I” ends and where “others” begin is not really clear, but, rather, fluid and evolving in time, space and context.

We decided to explore this concept: “inhabiting” as an active, participatory, interconnected experience.

A question came up: how can contemporary human beings acquire this experience of interconnectedness?

When we tried looking for answers, we realized that we actually feel it all the time.

Digital technologies and networks, and the experiences, services, devices, tools which use them and which have become part of our ordinary lives have brought this possibility in our perception of normality. Researchers such as Marshall McLuhan, Vilém Flusser and many others explained how technologies represent extensions, propagations and transformations of our senses and of our nervous systems and many artists, designers, technologists have explored the ways in which both ordinary and extraordinary technologies mutate our perceptions, relations and interactions.

For maybe the first time in human history we have become able to interconnect with potentially every person on earth, and also with plants, objects, buildings. Through communication and messaging we are able to experience people’s thoughts, emotions, expressions. Through sensors and actuators we are able to experience people’s hearts, brain activity, blood flowing in veins and body parameters. The same sensors can be used to sense the evolution of the conditions of plants, of online phenomena, of objects as they move, rotate, heat or cool, of entire buildings and of the ways in which people, energy, communication, interaction flow in them.

With wearable technologies and prosthetics all of this information can come onto our bodies, adding what we can call, to all effects, augmented sensorialities: additional senses, new sights, hearings, tactilities which enable us to experience phenomena on our skins and bodies.

This remarkable opportunity also hides complex implications, both positive and negative: the transformation of identity; the mutation of the perception of the boundaries of the body; the implications for privacy, control, freedom and basic human rights; the ethical and legal implications of data collection and, on the other side, of materialising data and new sensibilities on the body; the ways in which emotions, expressions, opinions are encoded to be transformed from unstructured data (test, images, videos, sounds) to structured data; interface and data biopolitics.

When we launched the project La Cura in 2012 we experienced what we informally call the “ubiquitous body”: hundreds of thousands of people connected through networks which use media as different as the Internet and physical hugs, and in which an enormous polyphony of actions, approaches, methods, techniques, disciplines and attitudes move towards the achievement of a single goal: the myriads become an ecosystem which, as ecosystems do, preserves their singularity/difference and uses them to achieve the dynamic balances which lead to homeostasis, the well being of the ecosystem, obtained through the participation of all of its members.

What would happen if we designed a technology, a method, something, which could apply this concept to “inhabiting the planet”?

What would happen if we created an additional sense which, in perspective, could help us to sense the myriads of ways in which people express the ways in which they “inhabit the planet”, on our skins and bodies, to experience the “ubiquitous body” and, thus, to take active part in this collective performance?

This is what we will explore during the summer school.
Summer School outputs/takeaways
During the summer school we will produce many different outputs and obtain different takeaways.

This below is a preliminary list:

A series of skills and competences
There will be multiple threads going on in the summer school
BigData
Social Media listening/monitoring/analysis 
Algorithms
Data Visualization, Information Visualization, Information Aesthetics
Physical Computing, Wearable Technologies, Network Connected devices
Identity, Branding, Meta-Branding
Participants to the summer school will receive basic training on all of these topics, including overviews and compendiums of all of the ways in which all of these topics can be confronted with
Then, groups will form, each on a single thread, to dive deep into each topic; here of all of the techniques explored in the overview we will study in deep one of them, to be able to contribute to a real project, the one we will implement in the summer school
A series of philosophical, technical, technological considerations
Each of the topics of the summer school has profound, complex, critical implications. Data and interface politics, privacy, surveillance, human rights and freedoms, legal issues, accessibility issues, digital, cultural, economic and technological divides, and more. While we explore the various technologies and techniques we will also take into account all of these issues, trying to assess them and to integrate the implications in our work
An exhibit at La Triennale di Milano, at the Expogate, for the Condividi la Conoscenza event
At the summer school we will produce a triptych of works which will be exhibited at La Triennale:
An installation
A wearable device
A real-time information visualization
Each will form a part of the overall concept for our augmented sense: the wearable for the body, the installation for the space, the visualization for the city
Participants will all be credited for the production, which will be documented in a catalogue
A new technological concept
The theme of creating an augmented sense has multiple valences and interpretations, and is a concept which is researched in multiple forms. The possibility to bring a technological sensibility to the body (sometimes called senseability) to groups of people and to entire cities, enabling them to sensorially experience complex phenomena, is a theme which has multiple usages: from disabilities, to the care for children and elderly, to industrial applications, to many more commercial, medical or entertaining usage scenarios. On top of that there are multiple interesting researches about how digital data can be used to stimulate the body to create additional sensibilities, and of the ways in which our brain’s plasticity can learn how to interpret them, leading to becoming a true additional sensoriality.
Our work will be, at the same time, an artwork, a design research process, and a scientific exploration, thus interconnecting arts, sciences, technologies and society
A series of technological and conceptual skills
We will actually make things, in order to transform what we learned into the capacity to make stuff.
All of the things which we learn will be documented and distributed using open licenses (such as CC or GNU), so that other people will be able to benefit from them
An open source project, which people will be able to use
Also the work which we will produce during the summer school (software code, schematics, 3d Models, How-to’s…) will be released as open source, so that it will be possible to both freely reuse them in other cases, and to contribute to their further expansion
A series of reports about how people in the world use technologies
And, then, one last thing, which sadly is not discussed enough when dealing with technologies. When we look, for example, at any map showing social networking activities, we will see some areas/times with no data. Always. And they’re always the same. This is not simply due to the fact that the people there don’t feel like using Facebook or Twitter. There are multiple divides in place: do the people there know how to use technology? Can they afford it? Is it in their imagination/culture to express using technology? Is there network coverage in that place? Is there electricity? Water? And so on. To this day many, many people cannot access and use technologies. This has enormous implications: how can, then, we use technologies to interconnect with All of the planet? How can we confront with these divides? What is on the map is just as interesting as what is not on the map. And we will confront with this, too.
Program structure
This is just a preliminary description of what will happen during the summer school, given here so that we all have a sense of what is going to take place and that we can also participate to moving things around if there’s something that is not clear or which seems insufficient or lacking some detail.

Here we go:

An Analysis Of An International Collaboration To Survey Augmented Reality Art.
AR is being used to activate sites ranging from Occupy Wall Street to the art exhibition ManifestAR @ ZERO ERO1 Biennial 2012 – presented by the Samek Art Gallery simultaneously at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, PA and at Silicon Valley in San Jose, CA . From these contemporary non-sites, and through the papers included in this special issue of LEA , artists ask you to reconsider the implications of the simple question wayn (where are you now?).

“Digital Dualism versus Augmented Reality”, Nathan Jurgenson
https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/02/24/digital-dualism-versus-augmented-reality/
"Some have a bias to see the digital and the physical as separate; what I am calling digital dualism. Digital dualists believe that the digital world is “virtual” and the physical world “real.” This bias motivates many of the critiques of sites like Facebook and the rest of the social web and I fundamentally think this digital dualism is a fallacy. Instead, I want to argue that the digital and physical are increasingly meshed, and want to call this opposite perspective that implodes atoms and bits rather than holding them conceptually separate augmented reality."

"The Point of Being", Derrick De Kerckhove
https://books.google.it/books?id=t84xBwAAQBAJ 
Augmented tactility is the sense of touch extended by technologies, electronic or otherwise. The most advanced technologies such as touch-screens, brain-wave management systems, tele-surgery and virtual engineering are rapidly expanding the uses of augmented tactility in society. Today there are many mechanized, alternative ways of knowing and understanding the environment, which often substitute for direct sensory perception. And these interfaces between body and world are by extension, paradoxically 'tactile'.

“Una stupita fatticità. Feticismi visuali tra corpi e metropoli.”, Massimo Canevacci Ribeiro
http://pontourbe.revues.org/1908 
Trans-urbanism means altering the normal condition of seeing the city, altering normal sensorialities, perspectives, sights and rhythms; feeling observed by "her", and desired by its active spaces which open as slits in the night, like dreams. Ethnographic attention and wonder begins here, focusing on each detail, which is interpreted in the relation between body-scape and location, between panoramic bodies and connections among place, space, zones, interstices and e-spaces.

"Can we create new senses for humans?", David Eagleman
https://www.ted.com/talks/david_eagleman_can_we_create_new_senses_for_humans?language=en 
As humans, we can perceive less than a ten-trillionth of all light waves. “Our experience of reality,” says neuroscientist David Eagleman, “is constrained by our biology.” He wants to change that. His research into our brain processes has led him to create new interfaces — such as a sensory vest — to take in previously unseen information about the world around us.


Data, Information
"My thoughts on the smart city", Rem Koolhaas
http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/my-thoughts-smart-city-rem-koolhaas.html 
What is the role of transgression in the smart city?

"Telepathically Urban", Jennifer Gabrys
https://research.gold.ac.uk/4544/1/Gabrys_Telepathically_Urban.pdf 
In the wireless city, communication technologies have been described as “utility fogs” and “pervasive networks” as well as “smart dust” in order to capture the possibly miniscule yet ubiquitous extent of wireless infrastructures. Telepathy is then a form of invisible communication that might describe how a wireless city continually talks to itself, circulating messages and programming urban ecologies.

"From a single line of code to an entire city: reframing thinking on code and the city", Rob Kitchin
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2520435 
"The Real-Time City? Big Data and Smart Urbanism", Rob Kitchin
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2289141&rec=1&srcabs=2520435&alg=1&pos=1 
‘Smart cities’ is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce ‘big data’ which enable real-time analysis of city life, new modes of technocratic urban governance, and a re-imagining of cities.

"Critical questions for big data", danah boyd and Kate Crawford
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878 
The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.


"Legibility and Interpretability in Predictive Models (of Cities)", Anthony Townsend
https://medium.com/@anthonymobile/legibility-and-interpretability-in-predictive-models-of-cities-687680b39274#.rhl5qgxq4 
While I still feel like we are finding our feet… we are still talking about “algorithms” with a sense of wonder and lack of nuance and technical background that we scoff at in the broader public’s use of terms like “big data”, we are making progress. We are moving beyond the fetishization of big data — the volume, veracity, velocity meme — and starting to realize that the real breakthroughs are happening at the other end of the funnel — its the algorithms. As Gary King told Harvard Magazine, more data and more computations “is nothing compared to a big algorithm”. We’re getting over the fascination with the abundance of this new resource (“data is the new oil” thinking) and homing in on the new infrastructure that will transform it into valuable products and services. In industrial age terms, we’ve gotten over the oil men and are now zeroing in on the chemists.

"Ghosts in the Algorithmic Resilience Machine", Dan McQuillan
http://www.internetartizans.org.uk/resilience-smartcity-democracy.html#resilience-smartcity-democracy 
If resilience is the mode of crisis governance and the smart city is a form of high-frequency resilience, what does the smart city mean for democracy? To understand the implications for the future of democracy, I want to look at the emerging mode of production through which both wider resilience and specifically the smart city are being produced; that is, through the algorithmic production of preemption. 
This preemption forecloses possible futures in favour of the preferred outcome. The smart city will be a concentrated vessel for algorithmic preemption and, because of this, it will be a machine for disassembling due process. 

"If everything is a network, nothing is a network", Mushon Zer-Aviv
https://visualisingadvocacy.org/blog/if-everything-network-nothing-network 
How the simplistic network diagram came to dominate our imagination and why we shouldn’t blindly go with the flow. 

“39 studies in human perception”, Kennedy Elliott
https://medium.com/@kennelliott/39-studies-about-human-perception-in-30-minutes-4728f9e31a73
“For the last several years, I’ve wondered about what we actually know from scientific studies about how humans perceive graphics. I’ve collected things here and there, but when I started to get into the thick of it, I realized how extensive this body of research really is. There is a lot that I’m leaving out. This is an extreme distillation of these studies. In reality, these are robust studies, many with multiple experiments each, loaded with meaningful nuance that I do not have time to address. These are very simplistic representations of one or two core findings. I encourage that you read them in their entirety and consider their complete findings.”




Social Networks
"Life on Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet", Sherry Turkle
http://web.mit.edu/sturkle/www/Life-on-the-Screen.html 
Life on the Screen is a book not about computers, but about people and how computers are causing us to reevaluate our identities in the age of the Internet. We are using life on the screen to engage in new ways of thinking about evolution, relationships, politics, sex, and the self.
Life on the Screen traces a set of boundary negotiations, telling the story of the changing impact of the computer on our psychological lives and our evolving ideas about minds, bodies, and machines. What is emerging, Turkle says, is a new sense of identity--as de-centered and multiple. She describes trends in computer design, in artificial intelligence, and in people's experiences of virtual environments that confirm a dramatic shift in our notions of self, other, machine, and world. The computer emerges as an object that brings postmodernism down to earth.

"Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship", danah m. boyd, Nicole B. Ellison
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x
The purpose of this introduction is to provide a conceptual, historical, and scholarly context for the articles in this collection. We begin by defining what constitutes a social network site and then present one perspective on the historical development of SNSs, drawing from personal interviews and public accounts of sites and their changes over time. Following this, we review recent scholarship on SNSs and attempt to contextualize and highlight key works. We conclude with a description of the articles included in this special section and suggestions for future research.

"Zooming into an Instagram City: Reading the local through social media", Nadav Hochman and Lev Manovich
http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4711/3698 
How are users’ experiences of production, sharing, and interaction with the media they create mediated by the interfaces of particular social media platforms? How can we use computational analysis and visualizations of the content of visual social media (e.g., user photos, as opposed to upload dates, locations, tags and other metadata) to study social and cultural patterns? How can we visualize this media on multiple spatial and temporal scales? In this paper, we examine these questions through the analysis of the popular mobile photo–sharing application Instagram. First, we analyze the affordances provided by the Instagram interface and the ways this interface and the application’s tools structure users’ understanding and use of the “Instagram medium.” Next, we compare the visual signatures of 13 different global cities using 2.3 million Instagram photos from these cities. Finally, we use spatio–temporal visualizations of over 200,000 Instagram photos uploaded in Tel Aviv, Israel over three months to show how they can offer social, cultural and political insights about people’s activities in particular locations and time periods.

"Netnography. Doing Ethnographic Research Online", Robert Kozinets
http://kozinets.net/archives/357 
With as many as 1 billion people now using online communities such as newsgroups [thats where it all began], blogs [remember when they were the latest thing?], forums [whats the difference between a forum and a newsgroup? dont know? Buy the Book!], social networking sites[i.e., Facebook and Orkut and a few others, since MySpace appears to be on life support], podcasting, videocasting [YouTubing], photosharing communities [we cant forget Flickr], and virtual worlds [is Second Life making a comeback? and, hey, are all these parenthetical comments starting to drive you crazy yet?], the internet is now an important site for research.

"No Sense of Place. The Impact of the Electronic Media on Social Behavior", Joshua Meyrowitz
https://global.oup.com/academic/product/no-sense-of-place-9780195042313?cc=it&lang=en& 
An award-winning seminal book that develops a groundbreaking theory on how changes in media influence everyday social behavior and identity.
Rather than focusing on media messages, Meyrowitz analyzes how new media transform the "situational geography" of everyday life.

"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life", Erving Goffman
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life 
The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life was the first book to treat face-to-face interaction as a subject of sociological study. Goffman treated it as a kind of report in which he frames out the theatrical performance that applies to face-to-face interactions. He believed that when an individual comes in contact with other people, that individual will attempt to control or guide the impression that others might make of him by changing or fixing his or her setting, appearance and manner. At the same time, the person the individual is interacting with is trying to form and obtain information about the individual.
How does this apply to the ways in which we present/represent ourselves online?

"The Time of the Tribes: the Decline of Individualism", Michel Maffesoli
http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117461.The_Time_of_the_Tribes 
https://books.google.it/books?id=CJx4wxkiTl4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false 
The tribus are more than a residual category of social life. They are the central feature and key social fact of our own experience of everyday living. Like other French theorists such as Michel De Certeau and Jean Baudrillard, Maffesoli takes up an engaged position within the flux of social life rather than at a cool distance. The effect is to produce an internal analysis of the 'sociality within' European societies too often known only through the simulacra of statistical demographics.

"Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks", Adam D. I. Kramera, Jamie E. Guilloryb, and Jeffrey T. Hancockb
http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full.pdf 
This is, to this date, maybe the most controversial report of an online experiment, which was conducted by Facebook inc, using unsuspecting users of their online platform as usaware test subjects. Read the publiser's expression of concern statement at the beginning of the publication.
The topic is, in itself, very interesting, but the way in which such experiments are conducted open up the discussion about the extreme power that subjects like Google and Facebook are assuming in our societies.




Identity
"Improper Names: Collective Pseudonyms from the Luddites to Anonymous", Marco Deseriis
https://muse.jhu.edu/book/42021 
On one hand, the improper name embeds the shielding effect of any pseudonym, that is, the pseudonym’s nominal function of protecting an individual by substituting her legal name qua marker of her identity. On the other hand, an improper name functions as an open multiplicity that can hardly be disambiguated and assigned a discrete referent.

"Branding in the Culural Economy", Niels Pilgaard Hansen, Peter Kalum Schou
http://studenttheses.cbs.dk/handle/10417/4023 
"Brands can act as support to the consumer’s identity. The framework is based on psychoanalysis and cultural theory, Cultural Branding and the Diffusion of Innovation theory. We analyse the term identity and how it is connected to branding from a theoretical standpoint. Furthermore we connect identity to culture."
How can an identity system support a cultural movement and awareness?

"Tribes Inc.: The New World of Tribalism", Bernard Cova, Robert Kozinets
http://www.binaryspark.com/classes/Fandom/readings/Consumer%20Tribes%20Chapter%201.PDF 
The consumer tribes in the chapters of this book are doing far more than that. They do not consume things without changing them; they cannot 'consume' a good without it becoming them and them becoming it; they cannot consume a service without engaging in a dance with the service provider, where the dance becomes the service. Participatory culture is everywhere.

“Beyond "Identity"”, Rogers Brubaker, Frederik Cooper
http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/brubaker/Publications/18_Beyond_Identity.pdf
We argue that the prevailing constructivist stance on identity – the attempt to "soften" the term, to acquit it of the charge of "essentialism" by stipulating that identities are constructed, fluid and multiple – leaves without a rationale for talking about "identities" at all and ill-equipped to examine the "hard" dynamics and essentialist claims of contemporary identity politics.
The exploration of the "identity" crisis in the social sciences.

“The Social Life of Things”, Arjun Appadurai
http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75629.The_Social_Life_of_Things 
“Things” have “social lives”, and this defines their value. How does this change as “things” come closer to our bodies, eventually merging to it, and as they represent vast relational networks?

“Architecture from the Outside”, Elizabeth Grosz
https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/architecture-outside
How is architecture experienced “from the outside”? By people who cannot access it? By those who are homeless, poor, different? And what has this got to do with technology, innovation, ecology and art? Philosopher Elizabeth Grosz, in this book, explores the Excess Space, and describes the opportunities which come from transgression and difference.


Generative/Wearable Art

"Divergent Generative Art Practices", Dejan Grba, Vladimir Todorović, Tatjana Todorović, Andreas Schlegel, Melentie Pandilovski
https://isea2016.scm.cityu.edu.hk/openconf/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=view.php&id=405&type=4&a= 
By assessing the perceptual interaction with generative art, we will continue to question the narrative and performative qualities of this relatively new form. These two sections will introduce us to the contemporary smart cities as venues for generative practices and a notion of engaging city dwellers to participate in this complex system of networks and devices. Furthermore, we will discuss the new potential divergences of generative art practice. Biotechnology and quantum mechanics open another unimaginable field of generative activities that, equally to other venues, require critical, analytical and creative use of technology.

"Closed systems: Generative art and Software Abstraction", Marius Watz
http://mariuswatz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/201005-Marius-Watz-Closed-Systems.pdf 
The notion of generative systems, where formal constructs are described in terms of parametric processes executed autonomously of their author , has recently gained popularity in art and design. Conceptually these systems provide a computational model of creativity, combining principles of unpredictability with the purity of logic. As Constructivism and Futurism attempted to invoke the possibility of a worldview based on industrial processes, so generative art presents us with a Weltanschauung of computation.


"It Is Forbidden Not to Touch", Peter Weibel
http://www06.zkm.de/zkmarchive/www02_pewe/html/images/stories/pdf/2006/0914_IT_IS_FORBIDDEN.pdf 
Some Remarks on the (Forgotten Parts of the) History of Interactivity and Virtuality.

"Embodying Emotion Sensing Space: Introducing emotional geographies", Joyce Davidson, Christine Milligan
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1464936042000317677 
In attempts to articulate emotion—to embody it linguistically—we speak of the ‘heights’ of joy and the ‘depths’ of despair, significant others are comfortingly close or distressingly distant. The articulation of emotion is, thus, spatially mediated in a manner that is not simply metaphorical. Our emotional relations and interactions weave through and help form the fabric of our unique personal geographies.

"An Emotional Compass: Harvesting Geo-located Emotional States from User Generated Content on Social Networks and Using them to Create a Novel Experience of Cities.", Salvatore Iaconesi, Oriana Persico

This paper describes the design and implementation of a novel mobile interface under the form of an emotional compass. The interface has been created using the possibility to access large number of geo-located user generated contents across multiple social networks, which have then been processed using Natural Language Analysis techniques, to understand the emotions expressed by Internet users in urban environments. This possibility gives rise to the innovative interface for urban navigation presented in this paper, and opens up the opportunity to conceptualize and implement novel forms of services.

"The art of wearable communication", Kate Hartman
https://www.ted.com/talks/kate_hartman_the_art_of_wearable_communication?language=en 
Artist Kate Hartman uses wearable electronics to explore how we communicate, with ourselves and with the world. In this quirky and thought-provoking talk, she shows the "Talk to Yourself Hat", the "Inflatable Heart", the "Glacier Embracing Suit", and other unexpected devices.

Design and implementation of wearable devices able to display human emotions – be them individual, group or global – on physical bodies.
The devices created in the process have been used to create 3 artistic performances as both proofs of concepts and as innovative forms of artistic and aesthetic expression: Talkers performance, OneAvatar and Conference Biofeedback.


"Visualising Emotional Landmarks in Cities", Salvatore Iaconesi, Oriana Persico

With mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, we have become able to produce a continuously evolving infoscape – the layer of information which forms our experience of the world, together with the physical landscape. Through social networks and other services and tools, we have become able to express our emotions, points of view, desires, expectations and wishes in ways that are able to influence others' actions, decisions and emotions.
Through this production we have become a peculiar type of sculptors, transforming our ephemeral, transient, temporary perceptions and expressions into tangible artifacts, which are disseminated in the environment. Images and texts are constantly published onto public spaces, shopping centers, offices, schools and streets, forming a new layer of reality. These artifacts contribute to the formation of our everyday experience of cities.



Materials
There will be materials dedicated to the whole summer school and to each of the groups in which the work will develop. Obviously, each participant will have access to all the materials, and not only to the ones of their group.

Dedicated to the whole school:

General reading list
Plenary presentations materials, including online repository and reference links to videos, datasets, interactive experiences…
Human Ecosystems software platform
Contacts list for all participants
Certificate of participation

Dedicated each group:

Reading list dedicated to each area of work
Overview presentation materials, covering for each area an array of the possible ways, methods and technologies which can be used to confront with that specific domain, complete with resources, reference links, case studies, links to how-tos and tutorials
Detail presentation materials, covering the strategy/approach/technology which will be used in depth during the summer school: of all the possible approaches presented during the overviews, we will use one, explaining why we chose it and how it allows to properly achieve our objectives. Links and references will be provided to case studies, tutorials, how-tos and tools.
Library/repository of software tools, schematics, libraries, components lists, configuration patterns, documentation, which can be used to do similar projects
A report on the activities which will show the steps of the process, the ways in which different groups have collaborated, and a review of the critical issues and of the ways in which they have been solved (so that people wishing to do the same things will be able to benefit from this)

Communication/Collaboration tools
There are 3 types of tools we will use for communication and collaboration:

Tools to communicate among all participants and with the participants of the single groups
Tools to store documents, software, configurations, schematics, images, application files and other digital assets
Tools to perform the interactions which will go on among the different groups
