In 2012 La Cura became a global performance that engaged millions of people all over the World. In 2016 Codice Edizioni edited a book about it. This summer La Cura launches its first international summer school in collaboration with La Triennale di Milano.
The event has been held in Florence at Design Institute ISIA Florence headquarters from 22nd to 26th August: the various outputs were shown at XXI Triennale di Milano International Exhibition from 3rd to 4th September, held during the “Condividi la Conoscenza” event.
Five days to explore the ubiquitous body in the hyper-connection era in which teachers, tutors and participants will wonder about the topic and possibility: “interconnect the planet in the era of ubiquitous technologies and hyper-connection”; to design a “technological augmented sensoriality” that makes us sensible to new web interactions.
