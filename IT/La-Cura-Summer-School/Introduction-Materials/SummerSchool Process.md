Introduction

This document highlights the structure of the Summer School, describing its phases and processes.
It is intended as an open document, and you are all invited to participate to it, so that we can design the best and most meaningful experience possible.

Two factors are stressed throughout the document:
- How to make the summer school a shared experience
- How to avoid disciplinary bubbles

What does it mean to make the summer school a shared experience?
By this concept we mean to describe an experience which is a platform for the expression of all of the parties involved, including the possibility for them to represent and to determine themselves, the possibility to have an active role in determining the objectives, aims, scopes and meanings of the experience itself, and to make all these things part of a collaborative discussion, establishing a social contract which is not focused solely of the “will of the majority”, but, rather, on the ways in which the various desires can co-exist.

This is a complex thing to achieve, and maybe we will partially fail. As we know from micropolitics, completely horizontal, bottom-up processes do not exist. Micro-hierarchies constantly form in our daily lives and in all the processes in which we take part, consciously and unconsciously: human relations are not flat (e.g.: horizontal or vertical) nor bidimensional (e.g.: bottom-up, top-down, transversal), but, rather, they are multi-dimensional, configuring themselves as complex networks according to time, context, space, proximity, objective, process, and many more dimensions.
And, on top of that, it is not even clear if processes which are completely horizontal or bottom-up are a good thing, or an effective one, or a fair one, as different people have different necessities and desires, and may also need to be assisted in order to be fully capable of representing themselves and their desires.
Furthermore, leadership is another important factor, especially when leaders have the sensibility and attitude to act as enablers for people’s freedoms and rights: those leaders can become, thus, an enabling infrastructure.

In this scenario, creating a “shared experience” will mean to take every possible care and sensibility to recognizing the complex human network which will come together in the summer school, to make sure that every part of it receives care and attention, and to try to act as much as possible as enablers for the expressions, freedoms, rights and desires of each node of the network, in constructing, conducting, managing, moderating and leading the experience.
This is a process which must involve everyone, and which can be achieved by making sure that the relational network is constantly clear, transparent and performable, meaning that it is open for public discussion and that can be questioned, with everyone, to shape it in the most meaningful ways. Distributed leadership as an enabler.

This task can be performed by establishing flows of communication, information and knowledge which are open for self reflection, observation, constructive and critical discussion, and also for conflict and difference: “information is difference that makes the difference” (Bateson).

The second issue which we will focus on is dedicated to avoiding disciplinary bubbles.

Ok: to make software, you have to know how to make software. And the same goes for graphics, hardware, woodworking, doing scientific research, cooking and so on.

But, one may question: what is it that you’re really making when you are making software, or a design?

When you are designing you are making concrete, materialized ideology. Your design includes your view on the world, you can’t avoid it. But your view on the world, luckily, is not the only one. Others may come from different cultures, disciplines, approaches, philosophies. Here, conflict arises, constantly. Because if you’re making software X, according to the ways in which you interpreted the results of your research, some different suggestions may come from philosophy, ethics, sociology, psychology, gourmet cooking, soccer, magic and theater performance. These are very important things, because they will determine whether your software is just another software (e.g.: a series of algorithms and administratively/bureaucratically defined interfaces which force people to enact your view on the world for a certain process, effectively exercising power and control onto them) or a cultural artefact, a “thing” which resonates with cultures, human beings, people, who can appropriate it, make it their own, use it as a platform for their own expression.

Or, in more formal terms, one in which the “user” has an active role in all the phases of the circuit of culture, pictured in the image below. One in which we can stop calling people “users”, and we can start calling them with their own names, the ones which they chose, in the way that they chose it, because they can “appropriate” not only “object”, but, also, its design.



Each dropdown menu, animation, part of installation, line of code, image has implications which are cultural, anthropological, psychological, cognitive, political. As Lawrence Lessig says: “Code is Law.” And Design is Law, and Architecture, and Engineering, and so on. The only way to make fair laws is to be open, transparent and welcoming to the different perspectives and to seriously and joyfully take them in consideration, to make better designs. And, even more, to push in the direction according to which not only this is possible, but is is also suggested, required, welcomed, beautiful.

## The phases of the Summer School
The diagram below shows the phases of the summer school.

*Welcome*
This phase will include:
Welcome!
An informal breakfast in a mediterranean style offered by the Summer School, will be the occasion to meet each other and introduce ourselves, share practical information (times, contacts, tasks, program, eating, activities….), introduce the tools we will use (communication, collaboration, social, accounts…)

How long: 1 hour

*Intro*
This phase will include a short presentation about why we’re here, from our (the organizers of the summer school) point of view, why is it meaningful for La Cura, what are the opportunities, and how we envision the developments of this process.

Who: Salvatore + Oriana ?
How long: 30 minutes + Q&A

*Overviews*
These are a series of presentations which introduce the threads of the summer school, one for each topic.
Their objective, for each topic, is to give an overview of what is “possible”: the most significant approaches and techniques/technologies which can be used (and have been used, with use cases) to perform such tasks and activities.

The first part of the morning of the first 2 days can be dedicated to them.

They are:

- Identity
Why do we have an ‘identity’ section in the summer school?

Exceptional and/or meaningful cases

Note: there are 2 other topics which could be worthwhile covering, but it is not clear how and if they could fit in the schedule. They are transversal, and, maybe, we could insert/distribute their coverage across the other ones, mentioning them.  As emerged in the discussion, the most interesting option is to organize a conversation in an informal format (such as an aperitive just after we finish the activities of the day).

These topics are:

- Algorithms
What are algorithms?
How are algorithms used around us, in social networks, services, advertising, streets, supermarkets…?
What are the implications at technical, technological, social, cultural, psychological and political level?
What are the legal implications of algorithms? (e.g.: roboethics, responsibility, identity, rights…)
The “algorithmization” of life
The “dictatorship” of Algorithms?
Exceptional and/or meaningful cases
- Interface/Data (bio)politics
What is Interface biopolitics? What is data biopolitics?
How do data and interfaces exercise power and control?
The “datafication” of life
Re-appropriation of data and interfaces: hacking biopolitics
Exceptional and/or meaningful cases

Who: 1-2 persons for each area
How long: 20-30 minutes each 
Q&A: 10-15 minutes 

*Coordination*
The work groups will work together, but from different perspectives and through different activities. Their work will come together through data.


In the coordination phase (which is a joint phase for all the participants) we will describe the data we are going to have available during the process, find an agreement on the ways in which to leverage and use such data, establish some working protocols on how to process and shape the data according to the needs of the groups and kick-off the activities of the groups.

Fundamentally:

- We will be able to use the Human Ecosystems [HE] (www.human-ecosystems.com ) to capture data from social networks, in 29 languages from all over the world
- We will be able to configure multiple types of research using HE, as we need (for example to search for expressions on how people “inhabit the planet”, or to understand if they express concerns about their privacy, or in ways which could be useful in constructing a generative identity system, etc)
- This data includes
    - Content (the expressions, messages, texts, images… generated by people on social networks)
    - Times (the times in which these expressions are made; each of them or as totals, averages…)
    - Locations (the geographic coordinates and place names of these expressions, either as single (lat,long) coordinates, or as grouped in geographical areas (cities, regions, nations, continents)
    - Topics (the topics to which these expressions refer, whether they are established by us, or detected as they emerge)
    - Emotions (the emotional characteristics of these expressions, as interpreted using Natural Language Analysis and classified using the Circumplex Model of Affect, shown in the image)
    - Relations (the weighted relational graphs with nodes and edges which is described by people’s interactions and conversations, and their meta-data)
- Each group will be able to use HE for its purposes, and agreement should be found on how to create the data-set (which will evolve in real-time, as HE is able to capture data continuously) which will constitute the foundation of the action
- The social media group will act as collector of all the requirements coming from the groups (including their own), and will configure the HE instances accordingly; they will also “criticize” these requirements, based on their research, pointing out the ways in which they may be incorrect, incapable of representing the ways in which people effectively express and represent themselves, damaging of people’s rights and freedoms, or other issues which may arise; agreements on how to confront with these criticalities will be found during the assemblies, during the project’s life-cycle (see below)

*Lifecycle*
The main life-cycle of the process will revolve around the activities of the groups, and from their moments of assembly.

The groups will work autonomously, but communicating as needed (and suggested) across different groups:

- The Social Media group
    - Will configure the needed HE instances, to perform the data collection processes
    - Will oversee the data being collected and the ways in which it is processed by algorithms (Natural Language Analysis, Emotional Analysis, Geographic Analysis…) to propose and enact variations which may address issues and problems detected
    - Will collect requirements from the other groups, establishing critical and practical dialogues about what they would need in terms of data collection and its elaboration, and transforming the results of these dialogues into data harvesting processes
    - Will collect the considerations and results which appear across the groups (including their own) to be organized systematically, in order to create the base material and draft for a position paper which will be among the outputs of the summer school (see below, in Outputs)
    - Will keep a simple journal describing their activities, the problems and issues they encountered (at technical, process, emotional, relational.. levels) and how they solved them
- The Installation/Wearable group
    - Will design the technologies, materials, software, electronic circuits and overall experience and layout of the installation and of the wearable device connected to it
    - Will communicate with the social media, identity and visualization groups, in order to propagate their needs and to adopt their suggestions, creating a harmonious composition between all areas
    - Will document their work through images, texts, software and configuration repositories, documentation, how-tos…
    - Will keep a simple journal describing their activities, the problems and issues they encountered (at technical, process, emotional, relational.. levels) and how they solved them
- The Data/Info Visualization group
    - Will design the technologies, materials, software, visual assets and overall experience and layout of the urban data/information visualization 
    - Will communicate with the social media, identity and installation groups, in order to propagate their needs and to adopt their suggestions, creating a harmonious composition between all areas
    - Will document their work through images, texts, software and configuration repositories, documentation, how-tos…
    - Will keep a simple journal describing their activities, the problems and issues they encountered (at technical, process, emotional, relational.. levels) and how they solved them
- The Identity group
    - Will design the technologies, materials, software, visual assets and overall experience and layout of the identity system, including all its propagations to the other groups 
    - Will communicate with the social media, visualization and installation groups, in order to propagate their needs and to adopt their suggestions, creating a harmonious composition between all areas
    - Will monitor the other groups’ activities, in order to verify that the identity guidelines are being followed and used, and that a consistent experience is created
    - Will understand how a “collective, connective” identity system can be created out of this whole initiative, and make or suggest the appropriate directions and actions to be followed/performed in order for this to happen
    - Will document their work through images, texts, software and configuration repositories, documentation, how-tos…
    - Will keep a simple journal describing their activities, the problems and issues they encountered (at technical, process, emotional, relational.. levels) and how they solved them

A series of Assemblies will see the groups come together to discuss the actions of the day. In this moment groups will briefly describe what they did (5-10 minutes max) and open up relevant discussions about issues, problems, doubts and suggestions which they may have come across in their activities. These will be confronted with by the whole assembly, that will look for possible solutions, reactions, actions, inventions, changes, to address them.

*Outputs*
There are multiple types of output coming from the summer school, each created and relevant both during the summer school itself and in the times that will come after it.


Each thread of the summer school will produce a set of outputs, which will also go together, forming a whole. Some others will be directly produced as whole.

The three main areas of Outputs are:

- Documentation
- Exhibit
- Communication/dissemination 

All documentation (including these preliminary documents) will be included in an open, accessible repository (currently GitHub), so that they can be browsed, read and used by others, creating, to all effect, a Knowledge Commons.

As described in the previous section, each group will produce a report/journal/diary, in which they will describe their activities, the problems and issues they encountered (at technical, process, emotional, relational.. levels) and how they solved them. These journals will also be kept on the repository, in an appropriate section, so that people will be able to benefit from it by knowing and evaluating the experience of the summer school and of its process, and to create different ones which try to address the problems which we found.

Each group will have a section in the same repository, in which to place all of the materials they produced:

- The Installation/Wearable group
    - Software code
    - Schematics
    - Configuration patterns
    - Documentation 
- The Social Media group
    - Documentation about the data harvesting and interpretation processes
    - Human Ecosystems
        - Configurations
        - APIs endpoint descriptions
        - Datasets
    - Documentation about the context, results and critical considerations (divides, intentions, capability to detect expressions…)
- The Data/Information Visualization group
    - Software code
    - Media assets
    - URL schemes to access the visualizations
    - Documentation
- The Identity Group
    - Concept 
    - Software code
    - Media assets
    - URL schemes to access the visualizations
    - Documentation

- Communicated to the press
- Proposed to a series of events/conferences/festivals for participation/inclusion, at Italian and International levels (we will keep everyone posted about this, and we will also ask for your collaboration, making it a participative effort)
