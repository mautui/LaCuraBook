## Summer School Structure

This folder contains the two document we have prepared to describe the structure of La Cura Summer School: **"Preparing for the summer school"** and **"Summer School - Process"**.
The documents, originally written and proposed by Salvatore Iaconesi, are the result of a of a series of iteration among the group involved in the organization of the project (professors/tutors, communication team, relations and coordination), and with participants.
Before the beginning of the Summer School the two documents were send to participant, inviting them to read, comment, criticize and eventually make new proposals on the structural and processual level of the event itself. Two hangout were organized to discuss the document, allowing participant to meet, introduce themselves, make questions, share doubts, expectations and desires about the upcoming event. The described actions and elements explain how we tried to "opensource" from scratch the building process of La Cura Summer School, creating the base for a radically open relational ecosystem.
We didn't want to design a "service", but an environment in which anyone can express, exists, co-exist and have a say. We did our best to make it happen from the very beginning.


### Summer School - Process

This document highlights the structure of the Summer School, describing its phases and processes. Two factors are stressed throughout the document:

- How the summer school is intended as a shared experience and how to make it;
- how to avoid disciplinary bubbles thanks to a transdiciplinary approach and communal influence.

### Preparing for the summer school

This document includes:

- An introduction on La Cura and the rise of La Cura SummerSchool as a merging of many different wills and shared visions;
- a description of what will be the outputs/takeaways coming from the Summer School;
- the program structure for the summer school;
- a commented reading list to deepen the various topics confronted during the summer school;
- the structure of the materials which will be produced for the summer school;
- the collaboration and communication tools used.
