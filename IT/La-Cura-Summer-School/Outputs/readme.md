### Open Source Restaurant
A temporary restaurant/bar was designed and installed during the event to create a physical point of dialogue, to talk, share ideas and socialize in the most informal moment: eating together. A cookbook was created, containing all the recipes experienced during the event and with the poems that chef-researcher Giorgio Cipolletta daily wrote inspired by colours, flavours and shapes of the ingredients. Together with the poems, Giorgio selected a series of literary, artistic and scientific references (such as books, artworks, installations, movies, academic papers) associated to each recipes. 
A transdiciplinary and sincretic experiment mixing food, culture, poetry, bodies in perfect synch with La Cura.
