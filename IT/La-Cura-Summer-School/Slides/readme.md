## Presentation Slides
The slides youâ€™ll find in this folder are the material presented during the first day of the Summer School.
Slides are divided into different presentation, one for each group that was organized: Physical installation, wearable, data visualization, social media listening and identity groups.


Each presentation tells an overview on its topic and deepens the implications in the context of the overall approach of the Summer School trying to pull a wire that interconnects all the parts of the process.
